Happy Hour is a web app that displays restaurants and bars with their happy hour times that exist around Boulder. We have the bars separated by their area, such as "Downtown" or "The Hill". We allow the user to filter the bars by their area as well as start time and end time, a user can also look for the name of a bar in the search field. A user can also look at the Bar's profile page which displays some information about the bars and some comments, that are anonymous. A user can login or sign up and have a profile where they can follow or unfollow bars. 

###Web Crawler

We included a web crawler that we wrote to get our data. We had some issues parsing the site we collected data from due to the format of the information. However, we got the vital information we needed and used it to populate our database. The site we pulled info from started in 2006 and we aren't sure when it was last updated, so some restaurants and bars may be out of business or their happy hours may be wrong.
